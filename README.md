# link-state-routing-algorithm
At the beginning of the program, each router will have a list of its neighbors, the ports through them
They communicate, and the weights on the arches between the neighbors. During the running of the program, each vertex in the graph (ie
and will be able to update the link state routing router (will build a neighborhood matrix of the entire graph, using an algorithm
