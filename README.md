# link-state-routing-algorithm
Each router have a list of its neighbors, the ports through them They communicate, and the weights on the arches between the neighbors.
During the running of the program, each vertex in the graph will build a neighborhood matrix of the entire graph, using link state routing algorithm,
and can update it in the various rounds. In addition each vertex is able to update the weight on its arc when the weight on the arc changes.
